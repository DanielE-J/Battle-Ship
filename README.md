## Deployment

### Version Control

The site was created using the Visual Studio Code editor and pushed to github to the remote repository Battleship_PP3_CI

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

- ```git add .``` - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.
- ```git commit -m "commit message"``` - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.
- ```git push``` - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### Heroku Deployment

The below steps were followed to deploy this project to Heroku:
- Go to Heroku and click "New" to create a new app.

- Choose an app name and region region, click "Create app".
- Navigate to Buildpacks and add buildpacks for Python and NodeJS (in that order).
- Navigate to "Deploy". Set the deployment method to Github and enter repository name and connect.
- Scroll down to Manual Deploy, select "main" branch and click "Deploy Branch".
- The app will now be deployed to heroku
